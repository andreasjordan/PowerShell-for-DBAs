How to use PowerShell as an IBM Informix database administrator.

In january 2023 I desided to not focus on the two IBM database systems Db2 and Informix anymore. Why? Because in generall you can connect and work with them the same way as I do with other database systems. But there are some specialties that need more customization both on the server and on the client side.

You will find all information in the 2023-01 release of this repository.

In case I have a project that uses Informix, I will update the code here again.
